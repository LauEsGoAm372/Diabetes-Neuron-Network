# Diabetes-Neuron-Network

This file is a simple implementation of a neural network using the tensorflow keras library on the Diabetes dataset. This neural network has 3 layers, the first input layer receives 8 inputs, the second dense or hidden layer receives 8 inputs and finally the output layer. As it is a classification problem, binary cross-entropy validation is used as a cost function and sigmoid is used as an activation function.



**Execution**
The program is a python script with .ipynb extension, which means that it can be easily visualized in development environments such as visual studio code, colab, deepnote and others.
